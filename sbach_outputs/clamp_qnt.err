Some weights of ClampModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /srv/hays-lab/scratch/sanisetty3/music_motion/clamp/clamp and are newly initialized: ['motion_projection.project_in.bias', 'motion_projection.project_in.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
